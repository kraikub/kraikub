# Open source Authentication Service for KU

Kraikub is a platform for KU developers that allows them to authenticate any KU students on their app with less than 10 lines of coding. Users can easily sign in to your app with their Nontsri account. Kraikub DOES NOT STORE any user's credentials like username and password. When users sign in to our platform, their username and password will be encrypted with the Asymmetric Encryption Algorithm (which is using RSA in this case) to secure their credentials while it was sent to Kasetsart University for authentication. Only Kasetsart University can read (decrypt) their credentials and not even Kraikub can read (decrypt) these.
