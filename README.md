# Katrade Accounts
Katrade Accounts is a authentication service that integrates with Kasetsart University API (Unofficial Project).
Katrade Accounts adapts the core concept of OAuth2.0 standard and be as an API adapter that plugs in to **myapi.ku.th**
which is a part of Kasetsart University APIs.

To understand Katrade Accounts, you might be familiar with **Sign in with Google** buttons which can be found on most of today's websites or applications. These buttons bring you to Google's authentication page to identify who you are and send some of your allowed personal data back to the website or the application owners to process them for their purposes.

Likewise, Katrade Account is an (unofficial) authentication gateway for Kasetsart University API. It helps developers to identify their users with Kasetsart University easier.

Katrade Account is a middleman between you (as both developers and users) and Kasetsart University. Our goal is to make the user's authentication much easier than before. Once the authentication is proficient, developers can use most of their time to deal with their best ideas and features.

## About Katrade (Team)

Katrade was founded by a group of Computer Engineering students at Kasetsart University. At first, Katrade is a team for software engineering class on 2021. But since the class has ended, we want to go beyond the projects in a classroom. Our goal is to make Kasetsart University a  place where students are not afraid to represent new ideas, create new things, and find solutions that make our university stronger and better. And our mission is to create awesome tools to make their dreams/ideas come true.
