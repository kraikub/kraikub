An authorization server was built base on OAuth 2.0 protocol with OpenID Connect supported. To learn more about how the protocol works, you can visit
[oauth.net](https://oauth.net/2/). Kraikub OAuth2 server use myapi.ku.th as an authentication service to support almost Kasetsart University students.

databases. You are totally safe and secure, Kraikub won't remember your credentials (such as username and password).
